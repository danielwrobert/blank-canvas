## Description

Blank Canvas is a base starting point for WordPress theme development, incorporating a bunch of swell best practices. 

### Usage

Drop the blank-canvas folder into your WordPress themes folder and have at it.

### References

This theme is based on a combination of the HTML5 Boilerplate project (http://html5boilerplate.com) and
Chris Coyier's Blank theme (http://digwp.com/2010/02/blank-wordpress-theme).

### Upcoming Features
- Will be adding a branch with Sass & Compass configuration and some helpful mixins.
- Will be adding branch with Grunt build script config (maybe in a branch with a bunch of dev tools ready to go).
