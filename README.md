##Description

Blank Canvas is a base starting point for WordPress theme development, incorporating a bunch of swell best practices. 

###Options

Traditional CSS setup or a SCSS-Compass setup ... choose your own adventure.

###Usage

After you have wisely chosen which option (above) to start with, you will either
a. discard the CSS folder and scss-style.css file (if you have chosen the traditional CSS route) OR
b. discard the style.css file and rename the scss-style.css file to style.css (if you have chosen the SCSS-Compass route).

After that, simply drop the whole blank-canvas folder into your WordPress themes folder and have at it.

###References

This theme is based on a combination of the HTML5 Boilerplate project (http://html5boilerplate.com) and
Chris Coyier's Blank theme (http://digwp.com/2010/02/blank-wordpress-theme).
